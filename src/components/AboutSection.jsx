            <h3>Our Mission</h3>

            <p>
              Subhojanam is ISKCON Visakhapatnam's initiative to serve nutritious,
              sacred meals to caregivers and their families at government hospitals.
              We bring the Lord's prasadam to those going through their hardest days.
            </p>

            <p>
              Every day, our dedicated team of volunteers distributes freshly prepared
              prasadam at multiple hospitals, ensuring no caregiver goes hungry while
              looking after their loved ones.
            </p>
